Three different families:

1. BSD: mostly macOS.
2. GNU
3. Proprietary source code unix.

Unix was created at Bell Labs, which was a massive (still is) organization.

People didn't care much about Unix, at the beginning. Mostly important, AT&T, the telecommunication company that owned (own?) Bell Labs, had the monopoly of telephone sources in the US. A condition to that agreement was that AT&T would not enter new markets. Hence, AT&T was prohibited to making money with Unix.

Unix then grew freely. One example of this is the adoption of Unix by Bill Joy, that created, in Berkeley, a unix distribuition known as Berkeley distribution.

The berkeley distribution was facilitated by Ken Thompson, the created of Unix. Thompson and students added features to the original Unix. Like the network stack, an implementation known as berkeley socket.

At some point, AT&T realized what was going on. So they started to commercialize Unix. This caused the "Unix wars" that resulted in a [lawsuite](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/832/790/1428569/).

In the between, there are a lot of efforts to try and make a version of BSD that was unencumbered by the original Unix code, such as NetBSD, FreeBSD. MacOS is one derivative from FreeBDS.

About about GNU/Linux? Now enters Richard Stallman. He worked to free Unix from the conflict with AT&T, and his way to approach that was to write a new one by himself. He shipped a lot of things (such as GNU C, GNU Compiler (GCC)), but he didn't ship a Kernel.

Linus Torvald, as a student, shared a kind of toy operating system that he was working on called Linux. Linux was a Kernel. And the Linux early contributos drew a lot from GNU directly. 

In the mean time, AT&T is trying to make their system work and sell it. Solaris.
