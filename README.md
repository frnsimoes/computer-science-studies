An inspiration for this is [Shichao's Notes](https://notes.shichao.io/), but the way I intend to structure these studies is not by summarizing full chapters. I'm working on problems. The structure of what I'm trying to do is something like this:

Problem -> Questions -> Answers -> Code solution

```markdown
-- Problem: Write a proxy with concurrency -- 

| Questions                | Answers              | Code solution            |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| What is a server?        | [question-answer.md] |                          |
| What is a proxy?         | [question-answer.md] |                          |
| What is IO Multiplexing? | [question-answer.md] | Code solving the problem |
```
