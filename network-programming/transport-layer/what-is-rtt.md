Round-tripe time. It's the time it takes for a packet to travel from the source to the destination and back again to the source. RTT is a measure of the latency in a network.

- RTT is typically measured in milliseconds.
- it is calculated by sending a packet from the source to the destination and measuring the time it takes for an acknowledgment to return to the source.

RTT is used to adjust the rate of data transmission. TCP uses RTT to dynamically adjust the size of the congestion window.
